## Introduction

Distributed systems introduce unique challenges that typically don't exist in standalone applications:

- Services may be scaled horizontally across multiple instances
- Components need to communicate across network boundaries
- Failures can occur in any part of the system at any time
- State must be carefully managed

This guide will help you navigate these challenges when writing Python applications for Kubernetes and other distributed environments. Click on any topic in the table of contents to learn more about best practices in that area.
